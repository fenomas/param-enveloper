Hey look, finally a sane way to automate parameters in Web Audio.

This is a small library for automating changes to an 
[AudioParam](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioParam)
(like a signal's gain or frequency).
It lets you schedule any series of ramps, sweeps, and delays,
and then later cancel at any arbitrary time and schedule new changes, 
*without* causing discontinuities (i.e. audible clicks).

(That may not sound like much, but suffice to say that the 
WebAudio API makes it **very** difficult, and this library makes it very easy.)

[Live demo](http://fenomas.github.io/param-enveloper/)

## Example

```js
var A=0.1, H=0.01, S=0.5, D=0.2, R=0.5  // or whatever
var param = masterVolumeNode.gain

// initialize, starting from 0 since this is a gain node
enveloper.initParam(param, 0)

// play a note by making an ADHSR envelope...
enveloper.startEnvelope(param, startTime)
enveloper.addRamp(param, A, 1)
enveloper.addHold(param, H)
enveloper.addSweep(param, -1, S, D)

// later, when the note release is triggered..
enveloper.startEnvelope(param, releaseTime)
enveloper.addRamp(param, R, 0, true)
```

The second call to `startEnvelope` calculates what value the param is 
scheduled to have at `releaseTime` and edits the current envelope to 
end at that value. This way any subsequent automation happens without discontinuities, even if a release happens during the attack ramp or whatever.


## Usage

Install via npm:

```sh
npm i --save param-enveloper
```

```js
import Enveloper from 'param-enveloper'
var enveloper = new Enveloper(audioCtx)
enveloper.initParam(param, baseValue)
// ...
```

## API

 * `var env = new Enveloper(ctx)`  
   Constructor takes an `AudioContext` reference.

 * `env.initParam(param, baseValue)`  
   Any param to be automated should be initted once. `baseValue` is the value the param will initially transition from.

 * `env.startEnvelope(param, time)`  
   Start a new envelope from `time`, canceling any subsequent changes. 
   If an envelope was already scheduled, it will be edited to end at whatever value it would have had at the specified time.

 * `env.addHold(param, duration)`  
   Hold the current value for the given duration.

 * `env.addRamp(param, duration, target, isExponential)`  
   Ramp from the current value to a new target. By default ramps are linear; set the final argument to true for an exponential ramp.

 * `env.addSweep(param, duration, target, timeConst)`  
   Adds a sweep towards the given target value. Remember that sweeps approach the specified target value, but never completely reach it.  
   If `duration` is a positive number, the sweep will last for the specified time and then end. Otherwise, the sweep will continue forever or until a new envelope is started (with `startEnvelope`).

 * `env.getValueAtTime(param, time)`  
   Queries what value the param is scheduled to have at a given time. Useful for e.g. making an attack ramp whose duration depends on the value started from.

> Note: When a sweep is added with non-positive duration, it is treated as 
an open-ended sweep that lasts forever. Scheduling a ramp or another sweep 
after this will throw an error; to add subsequent events either start a new envelope, or schedule a hold (whose duration will become the sweep's duration).


## Notes

To hack on this, use the local npm `build` / `start` scripts. 
If you don't have webpack installed globally, you'll need to do 
`npm i -D webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server` or similar.

Currently this library doesn't do much heavy error checking - 
doing unexpected things (e.g. scheduling events in the past) 
might throw errors or have undefined behavior.
